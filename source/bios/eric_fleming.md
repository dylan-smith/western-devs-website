Eric Fleming is a Senior Software Engineer just outside of Atlanta, Georgia. He's worked on various projects from lending platforms, CMS', bearing manufacturers, mobile apps, etc primarily in C# and .NET. Always looking to improve and learn the next exciting technology Eric has set his sights on embracing Azure and all it has to offer, especially Azure Functions.

At the moment another Western Dev Simon Timms, and Eric have created a YouTube channel called [Function Junction](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd6gCsSCtvU6qafadAZU_cQ) focusing on Azure Functions and the capabilities they can provide. When he isn't recording or preparing another video for Function Junction he is probably thinking about writing a new blog post over at [ericflemingblog](https://ericflemingblog.wordpress.com/).
