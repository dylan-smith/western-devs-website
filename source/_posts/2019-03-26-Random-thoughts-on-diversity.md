Internally, the Western Devs have had quite a few discussions lately on diversity, specifically in the IT industry. It can be a touchy topic, though it really shouldn't be, and even during our comparatively level-headed discussions, there were times when emotions heated up. This will be a kind of treatise of what I took from the conversations. I can't imagine it will change anyone's mind but as I've always maintained, I write this blog as much for me as I do for the readers. So we'll see how it goes...

> This topic is one of the reasons I will be forever grateful for my fellow Western Devs. Having a group of people who are open to exploring different viewpoints without passing (too much) judgement as you explore your own ideas is something that I encourage every person reading this to seek out in some form.

While diversity is a recurring topic for us (we've done a podcast on [barriers for women in technology](https://westerndevs.com/podcasts/podcast-barriers-for-women-in-technology/) and on [transparency](https://westerndevs.com/podcasts/Transparency/)), recent talk was initiated by, of all things, [a Gucci sweater](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/gucci-creative-director-says-unintended-racist-imagery-890-sweater-causes-n971261).

I liked how this incident played out overall. The sweater was released, people cried foul, Gucci pulled it and apologized. To me, if the first two events took place, the last one is about the best outcome that could be hoped for. If you want to be cynical, you can claim the whole thing was staged or that they weren't sincere or that the whole thing was overblown. I prefer not to be cynical; it gives me a headache. It makes me happier to assume people are genuine until they provide evidence to the contrary.

So the discussion began on the last point: was this overblown? It's something I hear about in the IT industry when people start talking about diversity. If predominantly white males are the only ones applying for the jobs and they're the ones that are qualified to do them, is there _really_ a problem?

Yes. Yes, there is.

> Okay, look. I know our About Us page makes this whole post look hypocritical. We've recognized this as a problem for us and have taken steps to fix it. I'll leave it at that except to say: this is a harder problem to solve than it looks like.

But I don't really want to talk to the people that don't think there's a diversity problem in our industry. To me, it's like trying to convert someone who's convinced climate change isn't real. If the overwhelming evidence, both real and anecdotal, hasn't done that by now, I'm invoking my family motto: You can't save everybody.

The more interesting people are the ones that recognize there's a problem but don't feel they can do anything about it or perhaps that it's not as important as it's been made out to be. I don't agree with the second point but I admit to being part of the first group much of the time.
