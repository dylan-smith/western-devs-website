excerpt: 79 Grade 3 kids had a blast being introduced to the world of computer science!

In case you missed it, I threw down the gauntlet to my fellow WesternDev members in September, stating that [I will donate $100 CAD to Code.org®][4]
if any of them are able to participate in [Computer Science Education Week][1].

First, I had to step up and walk the walk, and I succeeded better than I had expected.

## 2 Days - 4 Classes - 79 Grade 3 Students == Success

This year it was very easy to organize an hour of code session at my youngest son's school. We had tried 2 years ago and the school board was leary so we didn't get a chance to do it.
Last year, the school board was aware of Hour of Code and already actively encouraging teachers to try and participate so we did 2 classes last year.

This year we were able to organize 4 classes of Hour Of Code sessions for the all of the Grade 3 kids in the school. I did 2 back-to-back on a Tuesday morning, and another 2 on the Thursday morning.
This ended up being a really great schedule and made running the sessions very easy because all of the Grade 3 students are in a school building together and the classrooms are side-by-side.

## WesternDevs Response

When I issued the challenge to my fellow WesternDev members, I recognized it is actually a very hard task to organize and execute an #HourOfCode event. The technical aspects of #HourOfCode is very easy, 
but the logistics of coordinating with schools/organizations to get classroom time and computers is very difficult.

That said, one of my fellow WesternDev members, [James Chambers][5] was able to get TWO (2) session organized! They will be run during the week of Dec. 19. I know this isn't technically during 
[Computer Science Education Week][1] but I'm going to let that slide and [donate $100 CAD to Code.org®][4] for [James Chambers][5] meeting the challenge. James has promised me that a blog post (with PICS!)
will be following in the coming weeks! I'll update this post when that happens!

I'm also going to [donate $100 CAD to Code.org®][4] for myself as I think that besides my time, this is a very important cause and they need our financial support as well as our support in time and effort.

Thank you all for reading. I hope I've encouraged you all to run an #HourOfCode session in your local community in the near future!!
