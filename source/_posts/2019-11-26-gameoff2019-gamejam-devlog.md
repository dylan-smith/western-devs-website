For the past month I have been participating in the GameOff 2019 Gamejam hosted by GitHub over on Itch.io and I've been devlogging about it over on my YouTube channel.

For the past year or so, I've been working on learning and getting into video game development (a.k.a. gamedev) as a sort of side thing to the whole enterprise cloud architect thing that I do during the day.

In order to focus my effort, I decided that I would participate in the GitHub hosted [GameOff 2019 Game Jam on Itch.io][1]. It's been a ride to say the least, but as I've been doing it, I've been doing a devlog series on YouTube about my progress and my thoughts throughout the competition.

## Where Do I Find the Vlog
You're in the right spot, as I'm going to cross post my [Itch.io][2] project devlog posts here, but you can also follow along on my [YouTube channel][3] if you're into that sort of thing, or you can just [checkout the playlist here][4].

The game jam ends on December 1, and there is more work to be done, so stay tuned for more posts.

Thanks for playing. ~ DW
