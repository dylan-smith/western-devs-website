Want to design games but have no money? Never fear, for my game design toolbox (and process) can help get you started!

I've spent the past week working on the the game design for #CarScientist. What I noticed was that I didn't open a code editor or development tool once this whole week, and considering that's my comfort zone when it comes to any form of software development, I was both surprised and pleased that I managed to wear my design hat so well!

On top of just being in design mode, I avoided my other "excuse" which is to want and research what you don't have, which is usually some tool or domain I think is clever. This whole toolbox not only keeps me focused, but it keeps me on budget as well as you can get all of it for nothing. Take a look and let me know in the comments your thoughts on my game design toolbox, along with what tools you use.
