In this video, DW walks through the new features rolled out both in-game and behind the scenes for his LD46 game jam title.

## Side Notes

This release is an important one for me. 

First, off it's the first "beta" release which I've categorized as a moderately stable release, and includes a "complete gameplay loop" on purpose. There are still plenty of bugs (as the video even showed) but it works and playable.

Second, this release is the original vision of what I pictured the gamejam submission to be when D'Arcy and I came up with the idea back in April. Many months later, I have that release which says a lot about my prototyping and experimenting process (i.e. I'm too slow).

Lastly, I have multiple versions of the game out there including Linux/X11 and Windows versions. There's still a lot more to learn and do with the while devops setup for my projects, but this is a great step forward and can be reused with all my Godot-based projects moving forward.

Until the next one-- thanks for playing.
