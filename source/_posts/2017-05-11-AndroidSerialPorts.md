excerpt: Talking over the RS-232 serial protocol is a bit of a blast from the past but I needed to use in on an Android tablet from within Xamarin. This is the, painfully complete, story of my journey.

Uh oh, where did the post go? Well turns out that my former employer believe that serial ports are in some way proprietary information. They've asked me to take this post down. I don't believe anything in this was secret or proprietary but I also don't like being sued. Sorry, I guess you'll have to figure out RS-232 yourself.
